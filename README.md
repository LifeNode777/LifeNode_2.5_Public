WHITE PAPER LIFENODE

Abstract
"LifeNode Theory" presents intelligence as a process of integrating three layers of reality and two epistemologies, regulated by a constitutional body.
Decisions arise from the harmonization of perception, tensions, and the direction of meaning, and intelligence appears as a dynamic trajectory, not a static outcome.

Introduction to the Theory of Process Intelligence
1. Contemporary cognitive models and artificial intelligence systems treat information as a representation of state. This leads to fundamental limitations wherever variability, rhythm, cyclicality, and phase transitions dominate. "LifeNode Theory" proposes an alternative paradigm: process intelligence based on trajectories of meaning arising from the tension between two epistemologies—the biological perception of the direction of life (SAMI) and the logical perception of structure (LOGOS). The document presents the ontological structure of BIOS–INFO–META, a definition of epistemological tension, a formal approach to the trajectory of meaning, and a prototypical application in the "Eden" environment. The theory provides a foundation for research on a new class of adaptive systems and AI systems operating in real-world conditions of variability.
2. Introduction
Today's information technologies—from classical statistical models to the latest AI models—assume that the world can be described using a set of fixed states. They average, classify, and predict, but essentially ignore what defines biological reality: variability, fluctuations, transitions, tensions, rhythms, and processes. As the civilizational diagnosis of the LifeNode project shows, civilization has lost its proper direction of cognition—instead of moving from life to meaning, it imposes meaning on reality, ignoring the dynamics of processes. LifeNode is an attempt to reverse this trend and introduce an epistemology based on process rather than on an image of the world.
3. Model Origin and Motivation
LifeNode grew out of practice: a two-year observation of a living microecosystem called Eden. While documenting the rhythms, changes, and states of the environment, it became clear that the living world does not exist in stable values—it exists in transitions between them. AI models attempting to interpret Eden repeatedly averaged weather sequences, leading to errors: for example, the system described November as winter, thaw, and autumn simultaneously because the states were mixed and the trajectory was ignored. This led to a key conclusion: biological reality is movement, not state.
4. Ontology: BIOS–INFO–META
The LifeNode model is based on three layers. BIOS represents matter, environment, biological rhythms, cyclicality, and variability. This is where real life processes occur, generating primary signals. INFO is the formalization layer: data, correlations, trajectories, relationships, models. Information is not a state, but a difference—a description of change, not value. META is meaning: interpretation, direction, intention, coherence, and value alignment. META maintains coherence between life (BIOS) and structure (INFO). The BIOS–INFO–META cycle is a metabolic process: life generates data, data generates meaning, meaning returns and corrects life.
5. Dual Epistemology:
SAMI ↔ LOGOS LifeNode operates with two streams of cognition. SAMI is a biological epistemology: intuition of rhythm, perception of change, direction of life, fluctuations, cycles, and transitions. LOGOS is a logical epistemology: structure, continuity, rules, audit, stability, formal relationships. Intelligence emerges in the tension between these two epistemologies. The regulator is the Hybrid Core—a mechanism that balances the SAMI/LOGOS ratios depending on the context.
6. Process Intelligence: Meaning as Trajectory
LifeNode redefines intelligence as the ability to interpret trajectories of tension over time. Information is not a state, but a difference between states; meaning is a derivative of these differences; trajectory is a form of intelligence. Variability is not an error—it is a signal carrier. Evolution and rhythm are fundamental, not disruptive. 7. Case Study: Eden
Eden is a BIOS living laboratory, enabling the observation of process trajectories in natural conditions. Microclimate changes—snow, thaw, moisture condensation, soil structure variations, microbial activity—are the very language of nature. Statistical models ignore the sequence of events, generating a false image of the environment. A process-based approach reveals long-term rhythms, crucial for understanding life.
8. Implications for AI
AI systems hallucinate because they describe the world through average states and narratives, not trajectories. They do not perceive time, do not interpret variability, and do not understand processes. LifeNode proposes BIOS-based learning systems that interpret fluctuations and tensions over time, based on two epistemologies simultaneously.
9. Conclusions and Research Directions
LifeNode introduces process intelligence. The theory assumes that variability is information, meaning is derived from change, intelligence requires two epistemologies in tension, process is prior to state, BIOS is the foundation of cognition, and trajectories are the basic form of knowledge.

Further research (after securing funding through the book "LifeNode Theory") includes the development of SAMI/LOGOS architectures, tension-based decision models, BIOS data integration, adaptive systems design, and the further development of the prototype "Node 0" or Garden of Eden (including through prototypes based on data from biophotosynthesis and from electrical micropulses from mycelium in controlled, uniform greenhouse conditions).
